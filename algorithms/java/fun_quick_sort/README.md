# Quick Sort
Divide and conquer way to in-place sort. This is sorting algorithm is not stable, because in the partition part we need to swap the spot. In general, quick sort is faster than merge sort, even they are all O(nlogn) in average.<br>
time: O(nlogn) - average  O(n^2) - worst case<br>
space: O(nlogn) - average O(n^2) - worst case<br>
All space are using space on stack.
