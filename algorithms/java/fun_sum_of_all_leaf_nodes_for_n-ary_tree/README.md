# Get the sum of all the leaf nodes for an n-ary tree, **space complexity should be O(1)**. Design the class to represent the tree yourself.

This means we need to traverse the tree in O(1) space, but using the regular tree class both bfs and dfs can not do that. We can add a parent pointer to traverse the tree. Because when we traverse the n-ary tree it is hard to know which is the next child of the n-ary tree. We also need a reverse index map to help us know the index of the children to know the next child.

    class TreeNode {
        int val;
        List<TreeNode> children;
        Map<TreeNode, integer> reverseIndex;
        TreeNode parent;
    }

    TreeNode firstNode(TreeNode root) {
        return root;
    }
    TreeNode nextNode(TreeNode cur) {
        if (!cur.children.isEmpty()) return firstNode(cur.children.get(0));
        while (cur.parent != null && cur is cur.parent's last children) {
            cur = cur.parent;
        }
        return cur.parent's next children;
    }
Thus, we can change the tree node class for us easier to know which is the next child for a parent. That means we can add a pointer to between the children.

    class TreeNode {
        TreeNode parent;
        TreeNode eldestChild;
        TreeNode nextSibling;
    }
