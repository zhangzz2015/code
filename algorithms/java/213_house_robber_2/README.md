## dp
Because this is a circle. Then we can separate for two cases<br>
1. starting from index 0 to index n - 2 
2. starting from index 1 to index n - 1<br>
And we return the max of them as result.<br>
The dp induction rule is the same as before.<br>

time: O(n)<br>
space: O(1)
## backtrackign + memoization
Same induction rule and same separate idea.<br>

time: O(n)<br>
space: O(n)
