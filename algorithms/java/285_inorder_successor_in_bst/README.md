## solution
We will search for that target in the BST. And there are three cases for a node find in the BST for its successor.<br>
1. The successor is the grandparent of the target.
2. The successor is the smallest element in the right subtree.
3. The successor not exist.

time: O(height)<br>
space: O(1)
