We can partition the x to the left and all the constant numbers to the right.

We can also split the equation by "=", and count the coefficient and the constant separately.

1. if coefficients and constants are the same: infinite solutions
2. if coefficients are the same but constant is not: no solution
3. else: x = (right.constant - left.constant) / (left.coefficient - right.coefficient)

time: O(n)<br>
space: O(n)
