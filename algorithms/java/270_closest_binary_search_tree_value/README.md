## recursion
We can use recurion to solve the problem. We need to choose the way to go down the tree. But we need to record the closest result when we have.<br>
time: O(height) - height of the tree<br>
space: O(height) - call stack space
## iterative
We can also use iterative way to solve this problem. We go down one path and record a closet value.<br>
time: O(height)<br>
space: O(1)
