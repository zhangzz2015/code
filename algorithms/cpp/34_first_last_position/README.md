## binary search
We can use binary search to find the both of the index.

Here we can use the lower\_bound and upper\_bound in C++.

lower\_bound:<br>
return the iterator of the first element that is larger or equal to the target

upper\_bound:<br>
return the iterator of the first element that is larger than the target

time: O(logn)<br>
space: O(1)
