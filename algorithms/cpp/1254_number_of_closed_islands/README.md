## traverse
We can traverse the graph, and only count the number of islands when the islands does not cotain a node that is on the edge of the whole graph.<br>
We can use a boolean variable to keep track of if there is a node on the edge of the whole graph appear in one island.<br>

time: O(|E| + |V|)<br>
space: O(|V|)
